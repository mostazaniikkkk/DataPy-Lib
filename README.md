# DataPy Lib 🛠️

Welcome to the super duper repository of **DataPy Lib**! This is a library focused on creating Minecraft Datapacks.

> ⚠️ **NOTICE**: Currently, the project is in Alpha phase and is considered super unstable.

## Features 🌟

- Creates the basic structure of a datapack from scratch.
- Allows adding functions.

## Why create a library like this? 🤔

I had plenty of reasons. Starting off, I don't really like the format of mcfunction for larger projects, it ends up being a mess to organize everything and synchronize it, especially when updating projects or adding features. Using Python as a core to do everything, you can maintain a larger project in a simple and orderly way, and also thanks to the language, the skill gap that the use of this library has is relatively low.

> 📌 **NOTE**, this is closer to a Makefile than to a mod API like Forge. This tool **DOES NOT** support Python for Minecraft, it only takes care of organizing your Datapack, automates tasks and simplifies the process, so don't expect to be able to use statements like comparators, classes and other Python features within your Datapack.

## Goals to reach version 1.0.0 🎯

- Project documentation.
- Abstract the following functions:
  - Creation of items and blocks.
  - Implementation of recipes.
  - New achievements.
  - Automated Resource Pack creation.
- Upload the project as a Python pip library.
